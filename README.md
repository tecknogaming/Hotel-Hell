# Hotel-Hell
Theme: Scale
Idea: A game where you have to manage a hotel where diffrent rooms has diffrent prefferable tempatures in 
      diffrent seassons there will also be room/electric/water managing to make it harder ;)

Mechanics:
 - randomized room creation with diffrent styles for diffrent types of people
 - power and water usage limits for added challange
 - people/guests have diffrent room style/power and water usages
 - the player as the hotel CEO will have to also manage wich rooms are perfect for diffrent people
 - a way for the player to build diffrent rooms
 - upgrading the power/water limits

Loss Cases:
 - Going Bankrupt (in the negitive money zone for too long)
 - Getting a negitive review for too long
 - Having the hotel in chaos with people going crazy becuse they are in a room that are not perfect for them

End Goal:
The player will only have to last as long as possible without going haywire or 
getting bankrupt or have a negitive review. there *may* be a high score
